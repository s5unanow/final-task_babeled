Implemented features:
- base functionality;
- photos switcher (item detail page);
- shopping bag;
- "best offer";
- filter visual functionality;

Notes: 
1. In order to use shopping bag functionality site should be launch using web-server.
2. There are 2 different item pages. You could move to the second page using links from:
- start page -> first 2 items in the new Arrivals section
- catalog page -> any item after "Last weekend 50%..." section;

Have fun!
